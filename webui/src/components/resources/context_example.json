    "message": "The recent violent conflict in Gaza was sparked by Israeli airstrikes that killed three senior Islamic Jihad commanders, which Israel claimed was in response to rocket fire. However, residents in Gaza reported that uninvolved civilians were also hit in the initial strikes. Israel continued with more airstrikes, killing other senior Islamic Jihad leaders and destroying their command centers and rocket-launching sites. The agreement that brought calm did not address the underlying issues that cause fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. Israel has agreed to halt its policy of targeted strikes on Islamic Jihad leaders, but warned that it would respond to further threats with \"whatever needs to be done.\"",
