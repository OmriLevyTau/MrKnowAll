    "message": "The given information does not provide a specific number of people killed in Gaza. However, the document mentions that the Israeli-Palestinian fighting has surged in the West Bank under Israel's most right-wing government in history, and since the start of the year, 111 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, with at least half of them affiliated with militant groups, according to a tally by The Associated Press. It also states that in that time, 20 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Furthermore, there was an incident near the northern city of Jenin where Israeli police shot and killed a suspected Palestinian assailant who ran toward soldiers wielding a knife. Finally, the truce between Israel and Gaza could be further tested during an annual “Jerusalem Day” march by Israeli nationalists through the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.",
